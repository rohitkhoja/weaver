Example 1

Question:
“Which Product has highest sales and more than 85 percent feedback?”

Plan:
	1.	Sort products by sales in descending order.
	2.	Retrieve the top 5 products.
	3.	Use LLM to summarize customer feedback for these products.

Solution:

Step 1 - SQL:

CREATE TABLE sorted_sales AS  
SELECT *  
FROM products_data  
ORDER BY sales DESC;

Table name: sorted_sales
Step 2 - SQL:
CREATE TABLE top_5_products AS  
SELECT *  
FROM sorted_sales  
LIMIT 5;

Table name: top_5_products

Step 3 - LLM:
	•	Reason: To summarize customer feedback, which requires understanding text data.
	•	Table name: top_5_products
	•	Original column to be used: feedback
	•	LLM prompt: “Provide a concise summary of customer feedback for the following product feedback data: {feedback}”
	•	New column name: feedback_summary
